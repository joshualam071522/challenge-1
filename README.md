# <Horiseon-Code-Refactor>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

 The reason for this project was to clean up the html and css code in order for the website application to have a codebase that meets accessibility standards. Doing so will also help optimize search engines. To achieve this goal, the index file was modified to have semantic HTML elements and follow a standard structure. Other standard accessibility standards, such as alt attributes to img elements, and the title element in the head element, were also added. CSS file was also simplified in order to become more readable and easily modifable. Throughout the project, I was able to reinforce my knowledge on basic HTML and CSS structures and standards.
